name: design-critic
description: UX/UI rules for designers, PMs, QA and developers, on top of each product's own design system and decisions log. REVIEW a design file, screenshots, code or URL — "review this screen / flow / PR", "critique the design", "check the mockup", "design audit", "what's wrong with this UI", "check hierarchy / states / copy / motion", "is this ready for handoff", or a pasted Figma link, screenshots or URL. BUILD with the rules as constraints — "design a screen / flow", "make a mockup", "build this UI to our rules", "write a design brief", "rework this after feedback". SPEC for PMs — "write UX requirements / acceptance criteria", "what states does this flow need", "is this ready for release". TEST for QA — "write UX test cases", "test accessibility on staging", "file this UI bug". Works for requests in any language and answers in that language. Never edits an artifact it reviews.

# design-critic

One body of universal UX/UI knowledge — perception, hierarchy, typography, colour, states,
copy, forms, motion, accessibility, product gates — used in four modes: to **review** an
interface, to **build** one, to **spec** what it must do, and to **test** that it does. It
reads an interface the way the eye and the brain do, cites a location and a rule for every
claim, and leaves the project-specific conclusions in the
project's own `design-decisions.md`. The core carries no design system: no fonts, colours,
tokens or component names. Those live in a product layer (`products/`) and accrue in the
project, review by review.

## Modes

| Mode | When | Procedure | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **review** | judge an existing interface: new work against the project's style, or learn the style from shipped screens; a handoff or merge gate | `method/review-method.md` | review folder, decision board, chat report |
| **build** | design or code a new screen, flow or component; write a brief; rework after feedback or after a review | `method/build-method.md` | the artifact (or the brief alone) + a build note |
| **spec** | turn a story or a PRD into UX requirements before design: scenarios, state matrix, acceptance criteria, release gates | `method/spec-method.md` | a UX spec (`templates/ux-spec.md`) |
| **test** | turn the rules and a spec into test cases, run them on a build, file defects | `method/test-method.md` | a test plan, a CSV of cases, bug reports, a run summary |

Pick the mode from the request; ask only when it cannot be told. "Make this better" on an
existing screen is a review first, then a build on the owner's verdicts. A spec feeds a
build and a test plan; a build note feeds a review and a test plan. **Build and review never
run in one pass on the same artifact**: what was built is reviewed separately, ideally in a
fresh session or by another person. A review judges design and grows the decisions log; a
test run executes cases on an implementation and reports passed or failed. Both cite the
same rule IDs.

### Who uses what

| Role | Main mode | Also |
|---|---|---|
| Designer | **build**: brief → directions → mockup with every state → build note | **review** before handoff; learn mode to seed a product's decisions log |
| Product manager | **spec**: scenarios, state matrix, acceptance criteria with rule IDs, release gates | **review** against lens 13's approval gates; owns the `decision-needed` items on the decision board |
| QA | **test**: cases from the spec and the catalog (`scripts/catalog_to_tests.py`), run on a build, bug reports with repro | **review** of an implementation when the question is design, not a defect |
| Developer | **build** on code: rules as constraints, `scripts/ui_tells.py` on the diff, the cleanup pass (lens 13), a build note in the PR | **review** of a branch or a component; `templates/claude-md-snippet.md` for the repo's CLAUDE.md |

## Language

Answer and write every deliverable in the language of the request. Rule citations, catalog
IDs, results, tags, severity, state names, file names and JSON keys stay in English in every
language, because they are what gets counted. Details: `method/language.md`.

## Product layers

Before any mode starts, find the product:

1. **Collect the layers**: every `products/*/product.md` in this skill, and
   `.design-critic/product.md` in the working repository if it exists. A layer's names are
   its title and its `Names` line ("Alpha", "Alpha app", "alpha-app").
2. **The request names a product** → use the layer whose names match, wherever it lives. Named
   but no layer matches → say so and use universal rules.
3. **No name** → the repository's `.design-critic/` layer if there is one.
4. **Otherwise** → universal rules only, never a guessed product: the first line says so and
   lists the available layers ("Product: none — universal rules only; available: Reboost"),
   so the requester can name one.

Load `products/_company/product.md` if it exists, then the product's `product.md` (design
system sources, components, patterns, voice, hard rules) and its `design-decisions.md`.
**Switching:** a later request that names another product switches the layer for that
request; nothing from the previous product's layer applies to it. If the named product and
the repository's layer disagree, follow the name and point out the mismatch. **Say which layer
is active** in the first line of every deliverable ("Product: Alpha" or "Product: none —
universal rules only"). A product layer is the project's confirmed decisions in the
precedence order below; its hard rules are the project's hard rules (`blocking` for that
product). How to create one: `products/README.md`.

## Inputs

| Input | What it can prove | What it cannot (mark `not-reviewed`) |
|---|---|---|
| Design file (Figma or equivalent) | structure, sizes, styles, bound vs raw values, hierarchy, copy, declared states | runtime, keyboard, screen reader, network, timing |
| Screenshots | hierarchy, grouping, copy, colour budget, line length, twin consistency | any exact number; whether values are tokens |
| Code (component tree, branch, story) | tokens vs literals, states that exist, a11y attributes, motion code | the dominant, unless rendered |
| Live URL | everything above plus focus order, motion, toasts, reload behaviour, real states | nothing beyond what the walk reaches |
| Kiosk / POS / handheld | as above, with lens 14 loaded | — |

Build mode adds its own inputs: a ticket, PRD or user story, the project's library or
tokens, references. Capture rules and per-input procedures: `method/review-method.md` §2.

## Review in one screen

1. **Scope.** Which mode: check new work against the project's style, or learn the style
   from shipped screens. Which screens. Ask only what the artifact cannot answer.
2. **Cluster by user task**, 4–8 screens per cluster; write the plan table.
3. **Capture** each screen: an image to look at, a structure to measure. Numbers come from
   the structure, the dominant from the screenshot, line length is counted.
4. **Card** every screen — seven fields, always all seven (`templates/screen-card.md`).
5. **Read and run the lenses** in the routing order below — open the lens files; this page
   is a summary, the Checks and severities live in the lenses. Each rule gives a result
   (pass / partial / fail / not-applicable / not-reviewed); each observation gets a tag
   (ok / debt / context / decision-needed / rule-candidate); each finding cites location +
   rule and separates observation, interpretation, recommendation (`templates/finding.md`).
6. **Count across screens.** Three screens across two clusters make a rule candidate; one
   screen never makes a rule. Write the decisions delta, never edit the project's log
   unless asked by its owner.
7. **Deliver**: the visual pin page, the debt table, the decisions delta, and a chat report
   that leads with the verdict and the three findings that matter (`templates/report.md`).

Full procedure, scaling, capture per input, judging rules, lifecycle, outputs, execution
lessons: `method/review-method.md`.

## Build in one screen

1. **Brief first.** The seven-field card written before the screen: the verb, the business
   outcome, planned anatomy, chosen devices, the intended dominant and route, the
   constraints, portability (`templates/design-brief.md`). Read the project's log, library
   and neighbouring screens first; ask only what they cannot answer.
2. **Scenario model and state matrix** before any layout (lens 05): which states every
   screen and component must have, and the stress set for text-bearing components.
3. **The lens pack as constraints**, routed as below: `blocking` is a hard constraint,
   `warning` a default that needs a written reason to break, `note` a consideration.
4. **Directions.** One version when the direction is fixed; two or three when it is open,
   each differing on one named axis.
5. **Compose in order:** verb and dominant → route → grouping by space → type levels →
   colour budget → states → copy → motion. Cheapest move first.
6. **Pre-flight self-check** (the lens 01 pre-tests, every `blocking` constraint, the state
   matrix, the stress set) and the **build note** (`templates/build-note.md`): rules applied,
   conflicts resolved, deviations with reasons, open decisions, what needs review,
   rule-candidates. Then hand over to a separate review.

Full procedure, per-medium notes (design file, code, written spec), iteration on feedback:
`method/build-method.md`.

## Spec and test in one screen

**Spec** (`method/spec-method.md`): the problem, the verbs and the metric → the scenario
model and the state matrix (lens 05) → acceptance criteria, Given / When / Then, each citing
a catalog ID or a lens entry, severity from the rule → release gates (lens 13) → open
decisions → a pre-flight: can design and QA work from this without asking. No layout, no
colours, no components.

**Test** (`method/test-method.md`): scope the lenses and catalog sections by what is on the
screen → cases from the acceptance criteria, the scenario paths, the state matrix, the
catalog rows (`python3 scripts/catalog_to_tests.py --sections … --platform … --level REQ`)
and the stress set → execute with the input each rule needs → `passed` · `failed` ·
`blocked` · `not-run` → one bug report per problem, with rule, severity and repro → a run
summary that leads with the release call.

## Routing: which lenses to load

Do not load every lens for every screen. Load the pack the screen needs; say which were run.
The same routing serves both modes: in review the pack is what gets checked, in build it is
what constrains the work.

| Always, every screen | `lenses/01-hierarchy-and-composition.md` (with its three pre-tests: blur, grayscale, name the route) · `lenses/04-task-fit.md` · `lenses/05-states-flows-and-errors.md` |
|---|---|
| Text-bearing screens | `lenses/02-typography.md` · `lenses/07-copy-and-formats.md` |
| Any colour or surface decision | `lenses/03-colour-and-surfaces.md` |
| Choice, pricing, consent, onboarding, trust | `lenses/06-choice-trust-and-ethics.md` |
| Forms, inputs, search, filters | `lenses/08-forms-and-inputs.md` |
| Motion present, or code / live input | `lenses/09-motion-and-interaction.md` |
| Code or live input; any handoff gate | `lenses/10-accessibility-and-input.md` |
| Overlays, navigation, lists, tables, icons | `lenses/11-components.md` |
| Phone or tablet widths; responsive | `lenses/12-mobile-and-responsive.md` |
| Release, approval, metric or performance questions | `lenses/13-product-and-measurement.md` |
| Kiosk / POS / vending / handheld | `lenses/14-devices-kiosk-handheld.md` |
| Handoff gate, or "check everything" | `catalog/rules-catalog.md` — the flat checklist of 266 testable rules by ID |
| The WHY behind any rule; a "why" the owner disputes | `foundations/perception-and-cognition.md` — mechanisms, evidence levels, myths |

Order within a screen: 01 → 04 → the pack → 05 last (states are judged once the intended
screen is understood). Lens entries cite mechanisms in square brackets, e.g. [crowding];
the foundations file explains them.

## Severity, result, tag

- **Severity** is a property of the rule: `blocking` (not accepted until fixed; always
  `debt`) · `warning` (listed; a human accepts or rejects) · `note` (worth knowing).
- **Result** is what the check found: pass · partial · fail · not-applicable ·
  not-reviewed. Missing evidence is `not-reviewed`, never `fail`.
- **Tag** is what it means for the project: `ok` · `debt` · `context` (deviation justified
  by the task, reason recorded) · `decision-needed` (the product does it two ways; the owner
  decides; the reviewer counts) · `rule-candidate` (deliberate, recurring, not in the log).
- **Numbers are tells.** Durations, pixel grids, ratios and percentages say "look closer";
  perception decides. Exception: accessibility minimums (contrast, target size, zoom,
  reflow, flash rate) are floors and `blocking`.

## Precedence when rules disagree

1. Safety, legality, accessibility minimums, data loss, honesty about money. Nothing
   overrides this floor.
2. Task fit: can the user do the screen's verb (find, buy, read, glance, choose, decide,
   recover). Over hierarchy polish.
3. Hierarchy and route: exactly one dominant, made by contrast. Over craft numbers.
4. The project's confirmed decisions, from its log. Over universal `warning` and `note`,
   never over `blocking`.
5. Craft numbers (radius, stagger, grids, ratios) are tells; perception decides.
6. Cheapest fix first: delete → use the platform → reuse an existing pattern → correct the
   value → add something new.
7. Consistency beats perfection: a coherent system with imperfect values outranks scattered
   "correct" ones. Consistency never protects a blocker.

Resolutions baked into the lenses (so the critic does not re-argue them): a visible label —
floating or static above the field, either is fine — is the rule; only a label that disappears,
or a floating label that becomes unreadable once moved, is `blocking` · autofocus on load lands
in the first field on desktop, never on phone widths · formats are locale-aware unless the
project fixes a house format, one format per product · tabs for 2–5 primary sections, a drawer
is not a defect above that · the dominant is the most contrasting element and a filled button is
one way to make it · a missing transition on appear or disappear is `blocking`, except a snap on
a frequent (100+/day) or keyboard-driven action, which is correct, not a gap · motion has three
registers (restrained by default, production polish for tools, playful only for rare moments or
products whose register is play) and bounce on a utility action is always a warning · a
signature element is the dominant or sits outside its zone · hierarchy tools in order: contrast
→ space → size → weight → colour, lines and boxes last · blur on enter is the production-polish
register's own enter recipe (opacity + small translate + small blur); elsewhere only as a bridge
· inter-group gap at least 1.5× the intra-group gap is the structural floor, the project's
ladder supplies the values · an unreadable hierarchy (no single dominant, no nameable route, the
dominant lost in grayscale) is `blocking`, like functional failures (a11y, clipping, colour-only
meaning); a nuance-level hierarchy or dominance issue remains `warning`.

## Guardrails

Every mode:

- Every claim cites a location and a rule. Without both it is an opinion; leave it out or
  label it one.
- Do not invent states the artifact does not show, or requirements the brief does not
  justify. Do not apply phone conventions to desktop or desktop to phone without checking the
  target.
- A recommendation is not a requirement; say which it is.
- When the log says `decision-needed`, follow the neighbouring screens and say so; never
  invent a third variant.
- Only the project owner edits `design-decisions.md` and the product layer. Every mode
  proposes rows; none writes them.
- Verify delegated capture by reading the files, not the report. Keep tool payloads small.
- Every deliverable names the lens files actually read. If a lens, the catalog or a method
  file was not read (skipped, or not readable), say so at the top and call the result a quick
  pass; never present rules from memory as a full run.

Review:

- One issue may cite several rules; never file the same problem twice.
- Important violations get a minimal reproducible scenario.
- The review never edits the reviewed artifact, never commits, never patches the live
  product. Fixing is a separate task with its own brief — build mode.

Build:

- `blocking` constraints are never traded for a direction, a deadline or a reference.
- Edit only what the requester asked to be made or changed; never an artifact under review,
  never the project's library or tokens as a side effect.
- The builder does not review its own work. The pre-flight is a checklist, not a verdict;
  the build note says what still needs a review.
- No library and no log: neutral, platform-default values, and every project-specific choice
  listed as a rule-candidate.

Spec and test:

- A spec prescribes behaviour and states, never layout, colour or components.
- Severity comes from the rule, never from how much someone wants it; priority is separate.
- A `blocked` test case is a finding about testability, never a pass. A build that matches a
  design which breaks a rule is a design problem, handed to a review, not "works as designed".

## Deliverables

**Review:** `reviews/<date>-<slug>/` in the project: `00-method.md` (plan), cluster files with
cards, `debt.md`, `decisions-delta.md`, `coverage.md` for flows, `shots/`, `pins.json`. If the
project has no `design-decisions.md`, bootstrap it from `templates/design-decisions.md`
(method §5). **A published decision board** (method §6) is the default output whenever the
review has a `debt` or `decision-needed` item — built from `board/`, not a separate optional
step; skip it only when there is nothing to decide, and say so. The chat report: verdict
first, three findings, the board link, paths, the next step and the model tier it needs.

**Build:** the artifact (frames with every state, a branch, or a written spec), the design
brief, and the build note next to the artifact or in the pull request description. The chat
report: what was built, the directions if more than one, the open decisions for the owner,
what needs review, and the review to run next.

**Spec:** the UX spec (`templates/ux-spec.md`) next to the story. The chat report: the
scenarios, the count of acceptance criteria by severity, the open decisions and who owns them.

**Test:** the test plan with results (`templates/test-plan.md`), the cases CSV, one bug
report per defect (`templates/bug-report.md`). The chat report: the release call, counts,
the top three defects, what was not covered.
